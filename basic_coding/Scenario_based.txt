🔥 CLASS & OBJECT BASED CODING QUESTIONS (VERY COMMON)
1️⃣ Basic Class Design

Question:
Create a Employee class with:
attributes: name, salary
method: get_annual_salary()

Input:
Employee("Ravi", 50000)

Output:
600000

2️⃣ Inheritance (CORE QUESTION)

Question:
Create a base class Vehicle with method start().
Create a child class Car that overrides start().

Expected behavior:

Vehicle().start() → "Vehicle started"
Car().start()     → "Car started"

3️⃣ Method Overriding + super()

Question:
Extend parent method but still call parent logic using super().

Hint:
Interviewers want to see if you know when to use super().

4️⃣ Abstract Base Class (VERY IMPORTANT)

Question:
Create an abstract class Payment with method pay(amount)
Implement CreditCardPayment and UPIPayment.

Input:
payment = CreditCardPayment()
payment.pay(1000)


Output:
Paid 1000 using Credit Card

5️⃣ Polymorphism (REAL USE)

Question:
Create multiple classes with same method name calculate_salary()
Call them in a loop without checking object type.

Interviewer checks:
do you rely on isinstance()? (bad)
or pure polymorphism? (good)


🔥 CONSTRUCTOR & OBJECT LIFECYCLE
6️⃣ __init__ vs __new__

Question:
Demonstrate object creation using both.
(They won’t expect deep internals, but usage clarity.)

7️⃣ Class Variable vs Instance Variable

Question:
Show difference with example:
shared counter
per-object value


🔥 ENCAPSULATION / DATA HIDING
8️⃣ Private Variables

Question:
Create class with private variable and expose via getter/setter.

Check:
name mangling
property decorator

9️⃣ @property (VERY COMMON)

Question:
Create a read-only attribute using @property.


🔥 MULTIPLE INHERITANCE (TRICKY BUT ASKED)
🔟 MRO (Method Resolution Order)

Question:
Create diamond inheritance and print MRO.
Interviewers LOVE this.


🔥 MAGIC METHODS (PYTHON-SPECIFIC)
1️⃣1️⃣ Operator Overloading

Question:
Overload + operator for a class.

1️⃣2️⃣ __str__ vs __repr__

Question:
Demonstrate difference with example.

1️⃣3️⃣ Make Object Iterable

Question:
Create a class that can be iterated using for.

(Implement __iter__ and __next__.)


🔥 REALISTIC MINI-DESIGN QUESTIONS
1️⃣4️⃣ Logger Class

Question:
Design a Logger class:
singleton
log levels
file write
(They won’t expect perfection, but design thinking.)

1️⃣5️⃣ Bank Account System

Question:
Design:
Account (base)
SavingsAccount
CurrentAccount

Include:
withdraw
deposit
rules per account type


🔥 COMPOSITION (SENIOR SIGNAL)
1️⃣6️⃣ Composition vs Inheritance

Question:
Use composition instead of inheritance for:
Engine inside Car
Interviewers check design maturity.


🔥 EXCEPTION HANDLING IN CLASSES
1️⃣7️⃣ Custom Exception

Question:
Create InsufficientBalanceError and use it in class.


🔥 PYTHON-REAL WORLD TASKS
1️⃣8️⃣ Context Manager Class

Question:
Create a class that opens/closes file using with.

1️⃣9️⃣ Decorator Inside Class

Question:
Write decorator to log method execution time.

2️⃣0️⃣ Dataclasses

Question:
Rewrite class using @dataclass.
They check if you know modern Python.

🧠 WHAT INTERVIEWERS REALLY CHECK

At 3 YOE, they want to see:
Can you design, not just code
Do you know why inheritance is bad sometimes
Can you explain trade-offs
Are you Pythonic or Java-in-Python

⚠️ HARD TRUTH
If you cannot comfortably write:
a base class
a child class
override a method
use super()
apply @property

👉 you will struggle in mid-level interviews.
